An extension for VS Code for maintaining versions of your files easily without saving all the files content.

Every time a file is saved, Local History will compare the old version to the new version and save the differences. All differences are saved inside a folder called .lh

.lh folder is structured like the root folder for easy navigation.

Ignored files are stored in .lh/.lhignore as Regular Expressions.

Local History uses jsdiff by Kevin Decker
